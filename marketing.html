                    <p>The business will focus primarily on prescription drugs but will also give customers access to supplements, which can be specially requested from customers. These products can be either be purchased at Drug Drop’s physical location or via the use of the business’ delivery service which will deliver medication around the island at the customer's convenience. These orders will be done via the Drug Drop’s online site. Which will be made to fully comply with HIPPA standards. The business’ products will most likely be more expensive than the products of our competitors initially due to the need to recoup costs and the inclusion of a delivery service alongside the sale of prescription medication. However, the business will also provide an increased range of services to consumers. </p>

                    <p>The goal is to gradually reduce prices with the scale of the business and make products that are affordable to customers. The medication that the business distributes will be sold on a Cost-based pricing model with a markup being placed on the goods so that the business can make a profit. Special deals will also be available if a customer wants to order a bulk of products at one time. Delivery will be offered at a fixed cost that considers the price offered by other competitors on the market such as Phillips Pharmacy. With value being provided to the customer via the speed and reliability of the service.</p>

                    <p>The location must be cleared by health inspectors and be of sufficient quality to project an aura of trust and quality to Drug Drop’s consumers. Medicine will be sold and distributed from the business's physical location. Drug Drop also plans to utilize a direct sales strategy with as much disintermediation as possible. The business’ main method of distribution however will be the delivery of medicines directly to customers. This will be done via the company’s fleet of delivery vehicles and personnel as we believe that it is vital to cut out the middleman in our distribution process.</p>

                <div class="info">
                    <p>The products and services provided by Drug Drop will need to be marketed to the Barbadian population so that the target market is fully aware of the products and services offered. Drug Drop also must make our case for why we are a better option for customers than other competitors in the market, notably Phillips Pharmacy. Drug Drop plans to do this via a heavy push on social media as well as customer referrals on messaging services such as WhatsApp. Social media marketing will be a focal part of our strategy for reaching out to consumers, with a budget being allocated to advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. </p>
                    <p>To ensure that we cater to all our target market we will also place ads in widely used local newspapers and buy slots for radio adverts and broadcast testimonies on popular radio stations. There will also be a considerable focus on public relations and customer engagement and support so that the business succeeds in its goal of building a reliable consumer base. The business will also utilize viral marketing with the use of its tagline and unique branding.</p>
